title: How come when you declare a global variable in any Node.js file itâ€™s not really global to all modules?

**The module wrapper**

Before a module's code is executed, Node.js will wrap it with a function wrapper that looks like the following:

```js
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  // Module code actually lives in here
});
```

By doing this, Node.js achieves a few things:

- It keeps top-level variables (defined with var, const or let) scoped to the module rather than the global object.
- It helps to provide some global-looking variables that are actually specific to the module, such as:
  - The module and exports objects that the implementor can use to export values from the module.
  - The convenience variables **filename and **dirname, containing the module's absolute filename and directory path.

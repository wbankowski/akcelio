description: My public commitment to 100 Days Of Code Challenge.

### Challenge:

I will be programming for at least one hour a day for the next 100 days. The aim of this challenge is to move from the stage of "convenient" learning from online courses, tutorials, YouTube, videoblogs and books to the stage of self-writing a useful code, i.e. one that solves a real project problem. This is the moment when the image of one's skills collides with reality. In my case, this is also an experience to answer the question of where in your development as a programmer you are becoming valuable for a potential software house that will be ready to hire you. I intend to create a valuable project portfolio in GitHub in the course of this challenge. In line with the principles of this challenge, I will document the progress of the work in a diary. A link to this logbook can be found here [#100 Days Of Code Log](https://github.com/wbankowski/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md). On this blog [Akcel.io](https://akcel.io) I will present detailed descriptions of my projects together with new and valuable things that I will discover during this time.

### Start date:

August 8, 2018

### Rules:

1. I will tweet my progress every day using #100DaysOfCode
1. If I program at work, this time is not included in the challenge.
1. I will push my code on GitHub so that everyone can follow my progress.
1. I will update [Log](https://github.com/wbankowski/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) to complete my daily progress with links.
1. I will work on real projects, challenging myself. Time spent making guides, online courses, etc. is not a challenge.

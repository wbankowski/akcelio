Hello world! After almost twenty years of experience as **Interim Manager** dealing with enterprise restructuring I decided in 2017 to enter the world of technology and become a **Full-Stack Developer**. Although I've always been on friendly terms with computers, programming itself was a black magic for me. And so, step by step, detail by detail, I started to discover the mysterious world of :zero: and :one:, which turned out to be a fascinating place, drawing me in completely. After countless hours of learning, the time has finally come to use the acquired knowledge in some meaningful way. So I created [Akcel.io](https://akcel.io) - a place in the network describing my experience in using **MEVN technology (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js)**. It was **JavaScript** and **Vue.js** that opened my eyes and showed me countless opportunities for personal and professional development. We will see where this road will lead me :nerd_face:
